# Todo:

* Confirm speed of server

* Time bar

* Zoom in (Selective zoom of section of screen)
  
  * Alternatively, pick a set and have it zoom in, but that requires a set of variables of sizes for each video.

* Python into an exe with all the dependencies

* Timestamps on time bar

* Figure out how to get data from xlcx (raw data file), modify it, and create a temporary file of this type to have a user download
  
  * Get John to send me a variance range for each type of value (+- 0.0001?)
