# Todo:

* Confirm speed of server

* Test out 720p once get file from John

* Fix issue with time jump speed (SO SO SLOW)

* Zoom in (Selective zoom of section of screen)
  
  * Alternatively, pick a set and have it zoom in, but that requires a set of variables of sizes for each video.

* Figure out how to get data from xlcx (raw data file), modify it, and create a temporary file of this type to have a user download
  
  * John's variance for each data is +-0.0001
