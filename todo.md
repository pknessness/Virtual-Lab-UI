# Todo:

* Confirm speed of server

* Fix issue with time jump speed (SO SO SLOW) (VERY FAST FOR CHARPY) (VERY FAST FOR 720p)

* Zoom in (Selective zoom of section of screen)
  
  * Alternatively, pick a set and have it zoom in, but that requires a set of variables of sizes for each video.

* <u>Figure out how to get data from xlcx (raw data file), modify it (RANDOMIZE), and create a temporary file of this type to have a user download</u>
  
  * John's variance for each data is +-0.0001

* Get John to send me 3 separate videos (time synced hopefully) and try layering myself

* layering text on in post (python-level post)

* <u>move rawdata onto aws as well</u>

* <u>auto-detection of files in server</u>

* subtitles?

* add photos (in place of dial) for each test type and test material
  
  * use a frame directly from the final video
  
  * thumbnail

* when lags, just stop

* add arrows for "ultimte tensile strength, yield stress, and failure point", on graph

* bug when i cancel export data, crash

* bug when i export data that doesnt exist, crash
