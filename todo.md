# Todo:

* Confirm speed of server

* Fix issue with time jump speed (SO SO SLOW) (VERY FAST FOR CHARPY) (VERY FAST FOR 720p)

* Zoom in (Selective zoom of section of screen)
  
  * Alternatively, pick a set and have it zoom in, but that requires a set of variables of sizes for each video.

* Figure out how to get data from xlcx (raw data file), modify it, and create a temporary file of this type to have a user download
  
  * John's variance for each data is +-0.0001

* 

* Get John to send me 3 separate videos (time synced hopefully) and try layering myself

* layering text on in post (python-level post)

* move rawdata onto aws as well

* auto-detection of files in server

* subtitles?
