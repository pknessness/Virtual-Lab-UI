# Todo:

* Confirm speed of server

* Test out 720p once get file from John

* Fix issue with time jump speed (SO SO SLOW) (VERY FAST FOR CHARPY)

* Zoom in (Selective zoom of section of screen)
  
  * Alternatively, pick a set and have it zoom in, but that requires a set of variables of sizes for each video.

* Figure out how to get data from xlcx (raw data file), modify it, and create a temporary file of this type to have a user download
  
  * John's variance for each data is +-0.0001

* Remove red-error when a video plays successfully

* Make time bar look a little better
  
  * red where the time has passed

* Get John to send me 3 separate videos (time synced hopefully) and try layering myself

* new icon for exe

* layering text on in post (python-level post)

* need to make video freeze on end, not exit the pygame

* move rawdata onto aws as well

* auto-detection of files in server

* set up red-error for boto3 setup

* subtitles?
